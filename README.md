# School District Analysis
We are asked to analyze data from city schools math and reading standardized tests to find performance trends and patterns. We also looked at funding and how/if it related to standardized test scores. We are looking for trends in school performance which will help the school board make decisions with budget allotments. 

The family educational rights and privacy act was reviewed before analyzing this data to protect students privacy and the information was treated with confidentiality to protect the students.

## Process and Results
- A few different measures were looked at. There were 15 schools that were analyzed. First we gathered the total number of students and students per school. Then we looked at the total budget for all 15 schools, and budget per school. Then we broke it down to budget per student, per school. With this information we found that Huang High School has the highest budget per student, and Wilson High School has the lowest budget per student.

- Then we looked at the average math score per school. Wright High School had the highest at 83.6% and Huang High School had the lowest at 76.6%.

- For average reading scores, Pena High School had the highest percentage at 84%, and Ford High school had the lowest at 80.7%.

- We then looked at the percentage of students that passed both reading and math. To do this we first found the number of students who scored 70 or higher in each school. then we divided that by the total number of students. We found that Cabrera High School was the highest with 91.3% of students passing both math and reading, and Rodriguez High School had the lowest with 52.9%.

- When we looked at the top schools for overall passing scores, Cabrera is number one and Thomas is number two.

- We later found out that the data from the ninth grade scores at Thomas High School may have been tampered with so we removed those scores from our data to get more accurate results. This ended up not making too much of a difference in the long run but is still good information to have and be aware of.

- Also, we broke the schools down by size. Small with under 1000 students, medium with 1000-2000 students, or large with 2000-5000 students. With this information we noticed that students at the medium sized schools did the best with 90% overall passing. Small schools were a close second with 89.88% passing and large schools trailing very far behind with only 58.3%.

- Charter schools verse district school scores were also compaired. Charter schools had higher test scores than district schools. The overall passing percentage had the largest gap with 90% of charter school students passing and only 54% of overall students passing from district schools

## Summary
Here is what we can conclude from the information that was provided to us:
 - Charter Schools have a much higher percentage of overall passing reading and math scores
 - Large schools have a much lower passing percentage for math and reading.
 - Budget does not directly correlate to student success.
